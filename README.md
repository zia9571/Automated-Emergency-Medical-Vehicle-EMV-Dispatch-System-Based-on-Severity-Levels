# Automated Emergency Medical Vehicle (EMV) Dispatch System Based on Severity Levels üöë

This project aims to develop an **Automated Emergency Medical Vehicle Dispatch System** that detects accidents in real time, assesses their severity, and prioritizes emergency response based on severity levels. Using a hybrid deep learning approach, this system leverages **YOLOv8** and **Optical Flow** models to ensure accurate detection and classification of accidents.

## Features üåü
- **Real-Time Accident Detection**: Detects accidents using CCTV footage.
- **Severity Classification**: Classifies accidents into predefined severity levels.
- **Multi-Class Object Detection**: Detects vehicles (cars, trucks, motorcycles) alongside accidents.
- **Automated Dispatch**: Prioritizes emergency medical response based on accident severity.
